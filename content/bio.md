I am a second-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://econ.wisc.edu/) at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Prior to joining UW-Madison, I earned my M.S. in Applied Economics from the [Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management](https://dyson.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. I hold a B.S. in Finance from the [International School of Business &amp; Finance](https://isbf.sysu.edu.cn/en/) at Sun Yat-sen University.

My research interests lie at the intersection of **Empirical Industrial Organization**, **Labor Economics**, and **Urban Economics**, with a particular focus on the Chinese setting.

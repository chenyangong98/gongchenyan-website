  abstract    = {<b>Purpose</b> - This paper investigates the relationship between climate finance and climate ergodicity. More specifically the paper examines how climate ergodicity as measured by a mean-reverting Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process affects the value of climate-linked bonds.<br><br><b>Design/methodology/approach</b> - Bond valuation is evaluated using Monte Carlo methods of the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. The paper describes climate risk in terms of the Hurst coefficient and derives a direct linkage between the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process and the Hurst measure.<br><br><b>Findings</b> - We find that the ergodic property holds with Hurst coefficients between 0.025 and 0.01 which implies increases in climate standard deviation in the range of 25%–50%.<br><br><b>Practical implications</b> - The approach provides a means to stress-test the bond prices to uncover the probability distribution about the issue value of bonds. The methods can be used to price or stress-test bonds issued by firms in climate sensitive industries.},

  abstract    = {To achieve agricultural transformation in developing countries in the face of challenges such as climate change, the use of improved crop varieties needs a jumpstart. Using a randomized controlled trial in Uganda, we test how nudge theory can be harnessed to deliver increased adoption of improved crop varieties. We find a 7% treatment effect, though the effect is not robust to alternative specifications. We find compelling evidence for heterogeneous treatment effects, with robust treatment effects among those who experienced a stronger emotional connection to the nudges that we deployed. A key concept to help explain this is nostalgia: farmers prone to nostalgia responded more strongly to the traditional farming imagery used to nudge the adoption of improved varieties.},

  abstract    = {We estimate the causal effects of occupational delicensing on firm performance and management in the Chinese insurance industry. Using individual-level data from a major life insurance company and a sharp regression discontinuity design, we show that agents hired after the reform earn 75.2% lower first-month commissions, exhibit a 12.5% higher 12-month turnover rate, and are 12.0% less likely to be promoted. Difference-in-differences estimates reveal performance declines among incumbents (36.0%) and managers (44.0%), with spillovers through team-based compensation. Despite the workforce expansion and demographic shifts, aggregate commissions fall by 11.3%. Delicensing harms firm outcomes contrary to the reform's stated objectives.},
